# AUTOMATED ATTENDANCE SYSTEM USING COMPUTER VISION

The project Automated attendance System was designed and programed so
that the attendance system at collages and schools can take attendance in a simple
way and which will take less time. This system uses computer vision and face
recognition modules to scan the biometrics of the faces from the database and match
them with student faces which are being captured from the webcam and displays
students name in real time.
